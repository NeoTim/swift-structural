# How to Contribute

We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project. There are
just a few small guidelines you need to follow.

## StructuralCore Contributions

This submodule is intended to follow the Swift evolution proposal to introduce
the Structural protocol to the standard library. If you are interested in
contributing to the core, please participate in the design discusion on the
swift forums, rather than openning pull requests to change the design
in this repo.

## Examples, Tests and Benchmark Contributions

We are happy to accept contributions to the rest of the codabase to study the
potential applications of Structural and its performance. When adding benchmarks
please make sure to contribute a good non-Structural baseline to compare
against. This can be either an existing non-Structural implementation or a 
hand-coded specialized equivalent.

## Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License
Agreement (CLA). You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your
contribution; this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your
contributions as part of the project. Head over to
<https://cla.developers.google.com/> to see your current agreements on file or
to sign a new one.

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one
(even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it
again.

## Code reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult
[GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more
